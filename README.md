												*** Introduction ***

You are an energy which can be controlled by itself. Some kind of god. That energy is so big to fly through the universe and land on a planet like an asteroid and it happens.
When you draw near planet's land like a big fireball ready to explode on reached surface you suddenly freeze in several meters above land.

Now you can control your colossive energy but you know this is limited and furthermore it consumes by heating off. To survive you must piece out your energy. There is only one power that gives you that energy - this is your native aura that makes you stronger and gives you kind of energy you need to.

So there are two ways to find that aura and extract the energy from it: all creatures who have able to live can create an aura that makes you stronger and gives you kind of energy you need to but only if they want to give it you, if they need you and belief to you they begin to use whole their abilities to recreate that aura you need. The more power of belief, the more energy you get. The another way - find places in the universe that have your native aura.

So one day you can continue you travel further.

When you reach some higher levels of energy then you have happened a transformation. Transformations - major steps in your own development. When transformation happened, you have extra abilities (most speed or most tranquility) that have limited time to use them for learn something new you could not achieve earlier.

So you have 2 ways: use your limited energy to do any actions and miracles you want or use the energy to summon or develop creatures in that planet when you have landed on and try to make them your believers.
